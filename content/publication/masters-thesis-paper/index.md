abstract: "We study solitary wave propagation in 1D granular crystals with Hertz-like interaction potentials. We consider interfaces between media with different exponents in the interaction potential. For an interface with increasing interaction potential exponent along the propagation direction we obtain mainly transmission with delayed secondary transmitted and reflected pulses. For interfaces with decreasing interaction potential exponent we observe both significant reflection and transmission of the solitary wave, where the transmitted part of the wave forms a multipulse structure. We also investigate impurities consisting of beads with different interaction exponents compared to the media they are embedded in, and we find that the impurities cause both reflection and transmission, including the formation of multipulse structures, independent of whether the exponent in the impurities is smaller than in the surrounding media. We explain wave propagation effects at interfaces and impurities in terms of quasi-particle collisions. Next we consider wave propagation along Hertz-like granular chains of beads in the presence of disorder and periodicity in the interaction exponents present in the Hertz-like potential, modelling, for instance, inhomogeneity in the contact geometry between beads in the granular chain. We find that solitary waves in media with randomised interaction exponents (which models disorder in the contact geometry) experience exponential decay, where the dependence of the decay rate is similar to the case of randomised bead masses. In the periodic case of chains with interaction exponents alternating between two fixed values, we find qualitatively different propagation properties depending on the choice of the two exponents. In particular, we find regimes with either exponential decay or stable solitary wave propagation with pairwise collective behaviour. For some specific interaction exponent values, we observe a new type of stable confined wave which exhibits a periodically changing wave form. These results cast light on how inhomogeneity in the contact geometry will influence solitary wave propagation along Hertz-like granular chains."
