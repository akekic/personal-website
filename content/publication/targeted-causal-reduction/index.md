abstract: "Why does a phenomenon occur? Addressing this question is central to most scientific inquiries based on empirical observations, and often heavily relies on simulations of scientific models. As models become more intricate, deciphering the causes behind these phenomena in high-dimensional spaces of interconnected variables becomes increasingly challenging. Causal machine learning may assist scientists in the discovery of relevant and interpretable patterns of causation in simulations. We introduce Targeted Causal Reduction (TCR), a method for turning complex models into a concise set of causal factors that explain a specific target phenomenon. We derive an information theoretic objective to learn TCR from interventional data or simulations and propose algorithms to optimize this objective efficiently. TCR's ability to generate interpretable high-level explanations from complex models is demonstrated on toy and mechanical systems, illustrating its potential to assist scientists in the study of complex phenomena in a broad range of disciplines."
