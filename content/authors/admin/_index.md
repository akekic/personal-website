I'm a PhD Student at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), specializing in integrating causal inference and reasoning into machine learning algorithms.

Prior to my PhD, I worked as an applied scientist at [Zalando](https://engineering.zalando.com/), where I developed {{< staticref "publication/deep-learning-based/" "newtab" >}}machine-learning-based demand forecast models{{< /staticref >}} for price optimization.

My academic background includes studies in physics and applied mathematics at Heidelberg, Oxford, and Paris, with a specific focus on {{< staticref "publication/bachelors-thesis/" "newtab" >}}theoretical quantum dynamics{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "publication/masters-thesis-paper/" "newtab" >}}simulation methods{{< /staticref >}}.

On this website, I share projects that I work on.
