I'm a PhD Student at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) working on causality and machine learning. Previously I worked as an applied scientist at [Zalando](https://engineering.zalando.com/) developing sales forecasting models that are used for algorithmic price optimisation. On this website I write about things that I find interesting and projects I work on.
